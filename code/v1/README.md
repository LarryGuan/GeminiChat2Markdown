## Development Notes

*   **Icons:** The `images/` directory contains placeholder PNG files. **You MUST replace these with actual PNG image files** of the appropriate sizes (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels) for the extension to load correctly. Chrome extensions do not support SVG icons directly for `action` icons.
*   **Reload Extension:** If you encounter errors like 'Could not load icon...' after updating the `manifest.json` or replacing icon files, please ensure you have reloaded the extension on the `chrome://extensions` page.
*   **Content Script:** The `content.js` script is injected into the Gemini share page to extract chat data. It relies on specific HTML structures (`<share-turn-viewer>`, `<user-query>`, `<response-container>`, `.query-text`, `.markdown.markdown-main-panel`). If Gemini's HTML structure changes, this script may need updates.
*   **Background Script:** The `background.js` handles messages from the content script and manages the file download process.
